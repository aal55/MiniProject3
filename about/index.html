<h1>About</h1>
<p class="lead">Hi, my name is Aaron Leu, and I'm a sophomore Web and Information Systems major at NJIT.</p>
<p>As a Web and Information Systems major at one of the top 100 universities in the country, there is a general sense of
    pressure to live up to its reputation. However, I happen to thrive under pressure, which allows me to overcome
    almost any challenge. I also believe that the future lies in the internet, so by earning a degree from NJIT, I hope
    to help contribute to one of the greatest testaments to human ingenuity. Aside from school, I have several hobbies,
    including exercising, playing games, composing music, and spending time on the internet. As a student, I enjoy
    continuing to learn more about web development and myself as a person as I continue my journey to become the best I
    can be.</p>
<p>P.S. I hope whoever's reading this has a wonderful day!</p>
